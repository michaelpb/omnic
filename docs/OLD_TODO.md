- [X] Testing infrastructure
    - [X] @settings decorator (useful in general)
    - [X] Ensure Sanic is totally encapsulated
    - [X] Clean up ALMOST ALL warnings / noise generated by running tests
    - [X] Create context manager that uses ForegroundWorker to churn though the
      conversion pipeline in an expedient way so that tests can be written just
      as pytest.async
    - [X] Write tests for ForegroundWorker
    - [X] Clean up ALL stray output when run with -s
    - [X] ~Fully wrap spawning / process stuff so ALL built-in converters can
      actually be tested against~ Better solution: Just test get_command, wrap
      spawn only in unit test for ExecConverter
        - [X] Add tests for ExecConverter
        - [X] Add tests for builtin converters (testing all methods)
    - [X] Debug issue with `await Task()` on Python 3.6

- [X] Packaging + docs
    - [X] Clean up packaging and README.md
    - [X] Delete docs directory until API stabilizes and I can flesh it out
    - [X] Publish on PyPI

- [X] CLI commands
    - [X] Create CLI subcommand framework
    - [X] Clean up convert command
    - [X] Remove click dependency
    - [X] Very simple scaffolding to start new project

- [X] Fix packaging
    - [X] Include all python packages, exclude tests
    - [X] Include JS and HTML dependencies

- [X] Fix setup.py packaging, set up pypi
    - [X] Add to setup.py only the minimum needed packages
    - [X] Document which packages needed for which builtin stuff
    - [X] Move requirements file to test dir

## Done
- [X] Finish doc -> thumb proof of concept
    - [X] ExecConverter needs a "rename from" feature, that allows you to
      specify an output file that differs in name from the one that is expected

- [X] Work on some very simple refresh javascript to integrate

- [X] Need a few more file types to provide proper proof of concept
    - [X] DOC -> PDF
    - [X] PDF first page -> PNG (depends on above)
    - [X] OBJ/MESH/etc -> STL (meshlab)
    - [X] STL,OBJ -> PNG (jsc3d)
    - [X] Molecule file conversion and visualization, just because


- [X] Very admin simple panel:
    1. Paste in a URL
    2. It downloads and converts to TypedForeignResource
    3. It shows all possible paths from that filetype
    4. Shows thumbnail with live-reload

- [X] Worker unit tests

- [X] Basic integration tests for builtin

- [X] Rename to `builtin` (from contrib)

- [X] QoL settings improvement
    - [X] Make settings like Django so you import where you need instead of
      pass around a "config" object
    - [X] Swap out settings hack out for "singletons.py"
    - [X] Add import system like Django's, so that `settings.py` doesn't need
      to import anything

- [X] Decide on name: e.g. `OmniConverter`, or `omnic` for short. Move to
  /omnic/ repo then


# Look into 3D rendering

- [X] Work on JSC3D CLI
    - [X] Integrate JSC3D with node canvas
    - [X] STL -> PNG


## Thumb / media proof of concept
- [X] Build out the thumb converter

- [X] Build out the media service
    - The media service route has a TypeString in the URL
    - The media service route responds with the converted file, OR a
      placeholder file for that TypeString

- [X] Build out a default settings so it can be run for the original demo

- [X] Builtin placeholder

- [X] Delete old thumb demo code

- [X] Polish up and add tests for above

- [X] Expose `omnic` command as follows:
    - `omnic runserver` -- runs a server
    - `omnic convert --type=PNG file.pdf ` -- converts from PDF to PNG
    - `omnic startproject` -- scaffolding

- [X] Test suite for CLI
